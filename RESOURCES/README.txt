ML in python:

PyBrain: Various machine learning algorithms for Python programmers. Focuses on neural networks.
PyML: Machine Learning object oriented framework for Linux and Mac OS X focused on classification and regression by Asa Ben-Hur.
scikit-learn: Comprehensive Machine Learning toolkit for Python (based on SciPy with numpy and mathplotlib). "Ipython -pylab" provides interactive environment like Octave - scikit-learn provides optimized implementations of pretty well everything (using fast libraries like liblinear and libsvm). Should be used instead of Octave for research prototyping, production and especially for education.
tensor-flow: open source software library for machine learning.

Machine Learning frameworks and libraries in C++
mlpack: a scalable C++ machine learning library.
SHARK: a fast, modular, feature-rich open-source C++ machine learning library.
Dlib-ml: A Machine Learning Toolkit.
Waffles: A collection of command-line tools for researchers in machine learning, data mining, and related fields. All of the functionality is also provided in a clean C++ class library.
MLC++: a library of C++ classes for supervised machine learning.

Machine Learning frameworks and libraries in Java
Weka: A collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks.
Apache Mahout: A scalable machine learning library .
LIBLINEAR : LIBLINEAR -- A Library for Large Linear Classification. I think this link was mentioned in one of the lectures.
Deeplearning4j: Open-source, distributed, deep-learning library for the JVM. Integrated with Hadoop and Spark, DL4J is designed to be used on distributed GPUs and CPUs.
