###First assigment for the course "Machine learning" in coursera.
In this exercise, you will implement linear regression and get to see it workon data.

BACKGROUND OF THE PROBLEM:
In this part of this exercise,  you will implement linear regression with one variable to predict 
profits for a food truck.  Suppose you are the CEO of arestaurant  franchise  and  are  considering  different 
 cities  for  opening  a  newoutlet.  The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data forprofits 
and populations from the cities.

You would like to use this data to help you select which city to expand to next.
The fileex1data1.txtcontains the dataset for our linear regression prob-lem. 
 The first column is the population of a city and the second column isthe profit of a food truck in that city.
  A negative value for profit indicates aloss.Theex1.mscript has already been set up to load this data for you.
